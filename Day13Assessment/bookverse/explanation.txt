User fills the Add Book form → enters book details and clicks Submit.

The AddBookForm component calls the action creator → BookActions.addBook(payload).

That action creator uses Dependency Injection — it already has access to the Dispatcher and API (booksApi), which were passed from index.js when the app started.

The action first dispatches an event → BOOK_ADD_STARTED.

The Dispatcher sends that event to every listener (especially the Store).

The Store receives it, marks loading = true, and notifies all components (like Home) that something changed.

The Action then makes an API call (POST /books) to actually add the book.

When the server responds with success, the action dispatches another event → BOOK_ADD_SUCCESS (along with the new book data).

The Store handles this new action by adding that book to its internal list and setting loading = false.

The Store emits another change — components like Home re-render automatically with the updated book list.

All this happens without refreshing the page — that’s the SPA (Single Page Application) behavior.
